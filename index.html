                <p>Welcome, you have stumbled upon what is known as "THE GAME".
                Now I know you may be asking yourself why the emphasis in the 
                name? Good question, but sadly I can't provide you with the answer 
                until you have successfully won THE GAME. Trust us you want to know 
                why...
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="rules-of-game">
                <h2>Rules of THE GAME</h2>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>You must guess a number between 1 through 20</li>
                    <li>You can also chose 1 or 20 if you would like</li>
                    <li>You ONLY get 3 chances to guess the right number</li>
                    <li>If after 3 chances you fail then...</li>
                </ul>

            <p>You have won, and since you have won you are going 
                to be rewarded with the reason this game is heavily 
                emphasized. The... Reason... Is... because it's so much FUN!

            <p>Oh... I see... hmmm... This is awkward.
                 The only advice I got for you is that you win some 
                 and you lose a ton. You know what? You should try again
                  I know you can do it :D
